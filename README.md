<h3 align="center">Developed by JoÃ£o Volpato ðŸ’œ</h3>

## Discord Clone 
This project was developed just for study purposes, was one of my first ones, in the procees i used just HTML and CSS.
<br/><br/>
## What I've learned
This project, being one of my first "complex" projects, when it comes to just HTML and CSS, has given me a lot of experience and understanding of the importance of designing the ideas before trying to execute a vague plan.
<br/><br/>
## How can i see it
As the technologies used were only HTML and CSS, you can see the project right here on GitHub pages or clone the project and open its index.
